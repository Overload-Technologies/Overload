# What's Overload?
Overload is a free, open-source 3D game engine made in C++ with Lua as its scripting language.

Originally created in 2019 by [Benjamin VIRANIN](https://github.com/BenjaminViranin), [Max BRUN](https://github.com/maxbrundev), and [Adrien GIVRY](https://github.com/adriengivry) as a graduation project, it has since evolved into an community-driven initiative supported by dozens of contributors.

Overload pillars are:
- üê£ **Ease of use** ‚Äì Inspired by other commercial engines, so you feel right at home.
- üßä **Simplicity** ‚Äì Minimalistic by design, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- üí≠ **Pragmatic Design** ‚Äì Features are carefully considered and deeply integrated.
- üìÑ **Documentation** ‚Äì Scripting API and documented source-code.
- ü§ù **Community-Driven** ‚Äì Welcoming contributions and feedback from all developers.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Modern C++20** ‚Äì Leveraging the power and safety of up-to-date C++ features.

# Features
- Lua scripting
- Game editor
- Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)
- Custom shaders support
- Windows game building
- Profiling tools
- Material editor
- Spatial audio
- Rigidbody physics
- And many more to come...

Check out our [issues](https://github.com/Overload-Technologies/Overload/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Overload-Technologies/Overload/pulls) to learn more about what's coming next!

# Quick Start (TL;DR)
*Assuming you are on Windows, have Visual Studio 2022 installed, and have about 5 minutes to spare!*
1. Clone Overload
2. Inside of the repository folder, run `OpenInVisualStudio.bat`
3. Build the project, voil√†!

- **‚≠ê Bonus:** get one of Overload's [sample projects](https://github.com/Overload-Technologies/Overload/wiki/Sample-Projects)!
- **‚ú® Extra Bonus:** check-out the [documentation](https://github.com/Overload-Technologies/Overload/wiki).

# Architecture
Overload is divided into 11 modules: 9 libraries (SDK), and 2 executables (Applications).

## Overload SDK
The Overload SDK is the core of the engine. It is a set of libraries used by our applications: `OvGame` and `OvEditor`.
We designed theses libraries with reusability in mind. They are highly modular and easy to extract from a game engine context.
- `OvDebug`: Logging and assertions.
- `OvTools`: Serialization, file system, platform, events, clock, and more.
- `OvMaths`: Vectors, matrices, quaternions, transforms.
- `OvAudio`: Audio engine, built around [SoLoud](https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud).
- `OvPhysics`: Physics engine, built around [Bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3).
- `OvRendering`: Fully agnostic rendering engine (HAL), with OpenGL implementation using [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad).
- `OvWindowing`: Handles inputs and windows using [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw).
- `OvUI`: Widget-based UI, leveraging [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) under the hood.
- `OvCore`: Component-based scene system, scripting, and resource management.

## Overload Applications
Overload applications use the Overload SDK to operate.
- `OvGame`: A data-driven executable for any game built with Overload.
- `OvEditor`: An editor for building your game.

## Dependencies
Overload depends on a few third-party libraries:
- [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) (OpengGL Graphics API)
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) (Windowing and inputs)
- [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) (3D model loader)
- [Bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) (Physics)
- [SoLoud](https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud) (Audio)
- [Tinyxml2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2) (XML serializer)
- [Sol3](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) (Lua binding)
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (GUI)
- [Premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) (Project generation)

# Getting started
## Running Overload from a Release Build
Get started with Overload in no time by downloading one of our [release builds](https://github.com/Overload-Technologies/Overload/releases). While this is the fastest way to get started, you might miss out on some cool features we're cooking up!

After downloading the archive, unzip it and run the `Overload.exe` executable file.

## Building Overload from Sources

### Quick Start (For Visual Studio 2022)
To start working with Overload quickly, clone the repository and run the `OpenInVisualStudio.bat` script. Project files will be automatically generated, and Visual Studio will open with the generated solution (`Overload/Sources/Overload.sln`).

```powershell
# These 2 lines will clone Overload, generate project files, and open the Visual Studio solution.
git clone https://github.com/Overload-Technologies/Overload
.\Overload\OpenInVisualStudio.bat
```

### Generating Project Files (For Any IDE)
*Note: This step is performed automatically when using `OpenInVisualStudio.bat`*

Overload uses Premake5 to generate project files. To generate these files, execute the `GenerateProjects.bat` located in the `Scripts/` folder.

By default, `GenerateProjects.bat` will generate project files for Visual Studio 2022.

If you'd like to use another IDE, you'll need to run `GenerateProjects.bat` from the command line:

```powershell
.\Scripts\GenerateProjects.bat <ide_of_your_choice>
```

*Please refer to [Premake5's documentation](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake) to find supported IDEs.*

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some Premake5-supported IDEs might still not work with Overload.

### Building From the Command Line (MSVC Only)
*Note: Before building, make sure that you generated the Visual Studio solution.*

If you'd like to build Overload directly from the command line (without opening Visual Studio), you can use the `BuildAll.bat` script located in `Scripts/MSVC/`. By default, `BuildAll.bat` will build the project in `Debug` mode, but you can choose the configuration you want by providing an argument:
```powershell
.\Scripts\MSVC\BuildAll.bat Release
```
