## Using Sample Projects

### Version Compatibility

Before downloading or cloning any sample project, verify your Overload version to ensure compatibility. Sample projects are maintained for the [latest release](https://github.com/Overload-Technologies/Overload/releases), but previous versions remain accessible through Git tags.

### Finding the Right Version

Each sample project uses a structured tagging system to track version compatibility:

**Tag Format:** `made-for-overload-v{version}`

**Example:** For Overload v1.6, look for the `made-for-overload-v1.6` tag.

### Getting the Latest Updates

Tags mark major version upgrades, but projects may receive updates between versions. To find the most recent update for your Overload version:

1. Locate the tag for the **next** version (e.g., `made-for-overload-v1.5` if you're using v1.4)
2. Navigate to the commit immediately before that tag
3. This represents the latest update compatible with your version

**Example:** For the latest Overload v1.4 compatible version, find the `made-for-overload-v1.5` tag and use the previous commit.
